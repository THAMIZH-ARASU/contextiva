# Post MVP Vision
The Post-MVP vision for Contextiva is to evolve from a production-ready knowledge engine into a comprehensive, multi-modal, and decentralized ecosystem for agentic knowledge. This is structured in a clear, phased roadmap.

## Phase 2 Features (Roadmap v2.1 - Q1 2025)
- **GraphQL API**: Offer a GraphQL API as an alternative to REST for more flexible client-side data queries.
- Real-time Updates (WebSocket): Enable real-time notifications for changes in tasks, documents, or project status.
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Provide a visual dashboard for administrators to monitor system usage, query performance, and knowledge base health.
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Introduce full multi-tenancy to securely isolate data and operations between different organizations or users.

## Long-term Vision (Roadmap v2.2 - Q2 2025)
- **Advanced Architectural Patterns**: Implement Event Sourcing and the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern to create a fully auditable and even more scalable system.
- **Enhanced Observability**: Integrate distributed tracing to provide a complete, end-to-end view of requests as they flow through the system.
- **Advanced RAG Strategies**: Continue to innovate on the RAG system with new retrieval and synthesis techniques.

## Expansion Opportunities (Roadmap v3.0 - Q3 2025)
- **Microservices Architecture**: Decompose the monolith into a true microservices architecture to allow for independent scaling and development of components.
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Implement a service mesh for managing inter-service communication, security, and observability.
- **Multi-modal RAG**: Expand the RAG system to ingest, index, and query against images and audio, not just text.
- **Agent Marketplace**: Create a marketplace where developers can share and discover agents that are pre-configured to use the Contextiva engine.
