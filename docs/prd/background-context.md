# Background Context
The current generation of AI agents often operates statelessly, lacking a persistent, contextual "memory". This forces developers to repeatedly build bespoke, in-house knowledge systems, a significant engineering effort that detracts from building the agent's core intelligence. Existing solutions are often just libraries (like LangChain) that leave the infrastructure burden (database, API, security) on the user, or simple vector stores that lack the rich domain logic for managing projects and versioned documents.

Contextiva solves this by providing a standalone, production-ready knowledge engine built on Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It abstracts the entire knowledge infrastructure stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Redis) into a clean REST API and Model Context Protocol (MCP) service. This allows developers to stop rebuilding infrastructure and instead focus on building their agent's unique intelligence by consuming a ready-to-deploy "knowledge-as-a-service" backend.
