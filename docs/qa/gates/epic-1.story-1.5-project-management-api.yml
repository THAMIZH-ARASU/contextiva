  notes:
    - "Minor: Concrete ProjectRepository imported in API layer (acceptable for DI)"
    - "Follows Clean Architecture principles overall"

testing:
  e2e_tests: 23

  coverage: EXCELLENT
  scenarios:
    - Happy path (CRUD operations)
    - Validation errors (422)
    - Authentication (401)
    - Not found (404)
    - Edge cases (pagination, partial updates)

code_quality:
  strengths:
    - Multi-layer validation (Pydantic + Domain)
    - Comprehensive test coverage (23 tests)
    - Proper RESTful status codes
    - Partial updates with exclude_unset
    - Max limit protection (1000)
    - Clear documentation and docstrings
  
  improvements_suggested:

summary: |
  Story 1.5 implementation is EXCELLENT and ready for production. All 7 acceptance
  criteria fully satisfied with comprehensive implementation, proper authentication,
  robust validation, and thorough testing (23 E2E tests). Minor architectural note
  about concrete repository import is non-blocking and follows common FastAPI patterns.
  
  Manual testing verified all endpoints working correctly with proper status codes.
  Security controls in place (JWT auth, input validation). Clean Architecture
  principles followed. Zero blocking issues.

next_steps:
  - Merge to main branch
  - Deploy to staging/production
  - Proceed to Story 1.6 or next epic
