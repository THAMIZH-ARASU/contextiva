# Introduction
This document outlines the overall project architecture for Contextiva, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
**Status**: N/A - Greenfield project.

The architecture will be built from scratch.

The foundational scaffolding, including the Clean Architecture directory structure, core dependencies, Docker configuration, and database setup, will be created as part of PRD Epic 1, Story 1.1 ("Project Foundation & Scaffolding"). No external starter template will be used.
