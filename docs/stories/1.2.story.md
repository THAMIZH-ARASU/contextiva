# Story 1.2: Database & Observability Integration

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** AI Agent Developer,
**I want** the FastAPI application fully connected to PostgreSQL/pgvector with structured logging,
**so that** the app is ready for persistence and observability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `src/shared/config/settings.py` module is created to load all database and logging settings from environment variables.
2. A database connection module (e.g., `src/shared/infrastructure/database/connection.py`) is created and manages the connection pool.
3. An Alembic migration is created and run to enable the pgvector extension in the database.
4. A structured logging module (`src/shared/config/logging.py`) is created and integrated into the FastAPI app to output JSON-formatted logs (NFR9).
5. A middleware is added to log all incoming API requests with a unique request ID (NFR9).
6. The health check endpoint (GET `/api/v1/health`) is updated to successfully verify database connectivity.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement settings module (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `src/shared/config/settings.py` to load DB/Logging env vars [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
  - [ ] Use Pydantic Settings for validation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- [ ] Implement database connection (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `src/shared/infrastructure/database/connection.py` using asyncpg pool [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
  - [ ] Provide init/teardown hooks for FastAPI lifespan [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- [ ] Add Alembic migration to enable pgvector (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Initialize Alembic config if not present [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
  - [ ] Create migration executing `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;` [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- [ ] Structured logging (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `src/shared/config/logging.py` with JSON logger [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-standards]
  - [ ] Integrate logger into FastAPI app [Source: architecture/components.md]
- [ ] Request logging middleware (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add middleware generating request ID and logging method, path, status, duration [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-standards]
- [ ] Update health endpoint (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Perform a simple DB ping on `/api/v1/health` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- [ ] Tests
  - [ ] Integration test for DB connection init [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
  - [ ] E2E test verifying health reports DB ok [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#end-to-end-e2e-tests]

## Dev Notes

- **Tech Stack**: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector; asyncpg for connections; JSON logging. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Project Structure**: Place configuration in `src/shared/config/`, database pool in `src/shared/infrastructure/database/`, middleware under `src/api/middleware/`. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Logging Standards**: Output structured JSON logs; include request ID; log levels per environment. [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-standards]
- **Health Check**: Validate DB connectivity within handler or via injected dependency. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Testing**: Add integration tests with testcontainers for Postgres/pgvector; e2e test via httpx. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-infrastructure]

### Testing

- Organize tests per pyramid; integration tests under `tests/integration/` for DB; e2e under `tests/e2e/` for API. Use pytest, AAA pattern, and real services via containers. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
